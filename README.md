# Just Another Simple Raytracer

Basics based off the book "Computer Graphics From Scratch" by Gabriel Gambetta

## Use

Compile all and run `Start.java`.

From top down and left to right the GUI consists of:
- Render button
- Max reflective recursions
- Jump amount when pressing the keys(0-1)
- Render screen (simple render unless render button is pressed)

## TODO

- Render export
- more 3D file support
- Transparency
- Refraction
- Textures
- More visually pleasing and complex GUI
- More comments
- Eventually tools for building a scene
- Cleanup and better code organization
