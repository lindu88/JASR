# Just Another Simple Raytracer

Basics based off the book "Computer Graphics From Scratch" by Gabriel Gambetta

## Use

Compile all and run `Start.java`.

From top down the GUI consists of:
- Render button
- Rotation along x-axis (Rx) slider
- Ry slider
- Rz slider
- Max reflective recursions
- Camera origin text area -> "0 0 0"

## TODO

- Render export and GUI update
- 3D file support (for now STL because it's simple)
- Transparency
- Refraction
- Textures
- More visually pleasing and complex GUI
- More comments
- Eventually tools for building a scene
- Cleanup and better code organization
