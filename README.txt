Just Another Simple Raytracer

Based off the book "Computer Graphics From Scratch" by Gabriel Gambetta

So far only spheres can be rendered with basic lighting in the form of diffuse reflection, specular reflection, and shadows

Use: Compile and Run Start.java
From top down the gui consists of: Render button, yaw slider, pitch slider, roll slider, camera orgin text area -> "0 0 0"

TODO:
Mirror Reflections
transparency
Polygon Rendering
Textures
More visually pleasing and complex GUI

maybe a generic pair container
more comments

eventually tools for building a scene

cleanup and better code organization

change yaw, pitch, and roll to basic xyz rotations
