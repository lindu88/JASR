Just Another Simple Raytracer

Based off the book "Computer Graphics From Scratch" by Gabriel Gambetta

So far only spheres can be rendered with refelctions(specular,diffuse,mirror) and lighting(point,directional,ambient)

Use: Compile all and Run Start.java
From top down the gui consists of: Render button, Rotaion along x axis(Rx) slider, Ry slider, Rz slider,Max reflective recursions, camera orgin text area -> "0 0 0"

TODO:
Render export and gui update
triangle Rendering
3D file support (for now stl because it's simple)
transparency
refraction
Textures
More visually pleasing and complex GUI

maybe a generic pair container
more comments

eventually tools for building a scene

cleanup and better code organization
